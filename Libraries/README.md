# IPlug/IGraphics static libraries

This folder is home to static libraries that IPlug/IGraphics depends on (currently this only applies to macOS).

The build script build-cairo-mac.sh will download and build all the libraries required for cairo support, and will install them in the subfolder "install". You will also be able to download prebuilt versions which you can extract here.
